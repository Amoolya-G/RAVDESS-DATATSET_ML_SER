# RAVDESS-DATATSET_ML_SER
PROJECT(01)--EXTRACTING THE FEATURES FROM THE RAVDESS AUDIO DATA, ANALYSING THE DATASET, VISUALIZATION OF THE DATASET. OVERALL, EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON RAVDESS DATA!



PURPOSE OF PROJECT 2: DIMENSION REDUCTION USING PCA ON THE OBTAINED DATASET FROM RAVDESS DATA FROM THE PREVIOUS PROJECT. BUILDING THE MODEL FOR THE RAVDESS DTATASET AND FINDING OUT THE ACCURACY USING DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS.



CONCLUSION:
CONCLUDING BY SAYING WE GOT THE HIGHEST TEST ACCURACY SCORE OF 27.54% USING SVM AND SECOND HIGHEST OF 26.38% USING XGBOOST CLASSIFIER ALGORITHM. IN SVM, WE COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE 119 CORRECT CLASSIFICATION AND THE 4TH EMOTION I.E, SAD IS DETECTED THE MOST CORRECTLY.
